    <p class="intro">
      This is a brief, incomplete timeline of Palestine as a land and a people — long before the modern Zionist project, and through the period of occupation and resistance. It is not about erasing complexity, but about making one thing clear: Palestine was never “empty”, never “imaginary”, and never a blank space waiting for colonizers.
    </p>

    <div class="timeline">

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">Ancient periods – long before “B.C. / A.D.” borders mattered</div>
        <p>
          The land that is now called Palestine has been home to various Semitic peoples for thousands of years — Canaanite, Aramaean and others living, farming, trading, and building cities. It was always a lived place, with its own cultures and communities, not an empty stage for later myths.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">Classical empires (roughly 1st millennium BCE – early 1st millennium CE)</div>
        <p>
          The region passed through the control of successive empires — Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine. Names, rulers, and borders shifted, but the land remained inhabited by local populations rooted in their towns, villages, and traditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">7th century CE – Early Islamic period</div>
        <p>
          With the spread of Islam, Palestine became part of the broader Arab and Islamic world. Cities like Jerusalem, Gaza, Nablus, and Hebron developed as centers of religious, economic, and cultural life. Arabic gradually became the main language, and the population was overwhelmingly local.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">Ottoman rule (~1516 – 1917)</div>
        <p>
          For roughly 400 years, Palestine was administered within the Ottoman Empire. Villages, clan structures, cities, markets, and agricultural life developed in continuity. The population was largely Arab Muslim and Christian, with small Jewish communities living as part of the social fabric — not as a colonial project.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">Late 19th century – Rise of modern Zionism</div>
        <p>
          In Europe, political Zionism emerged as a nationalist movement seeking to establish a settler colony in Palestine. Supported later by imperial powers, it treated the land as a target for colonization, ignoring the indigenous majority already living there.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">1917 – Balfour Declaration</div>
        <p>
          The British government issued the Balfour Declaration, promising to support a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine — a colonial decision about someone else’s land, made without the consent of the indigenous population.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">1917–1948 – British Mandate & organized Zionist colonization</div>
        <p>
          Under British rule, Zionist institutions systematically bought land, built separate structures, and prepared for takeover. Palestinians resisted politically and through revolts, including the 1936–39 uprising, which was brutally suppressed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">1948 – The Nakba (Catastrophe)</div>
        <p>
          Zionist militias and later the declared state expelled around 750,000 Palestinians, destroyed more than 400–500 villages, and carried out massacres, producing a massive refugee population. This was not an accident of “war” but a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing to create a settler state with a Jewish majority.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">1967 – Expansion of occupation</div>
        <p>
          In 1967, the occupation extended to the remaining parts of Palestine (West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem), as well as other Arab lands. Military rule, settlements, land theft, and a regime of control and fragmentation intensified.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">From the late 20th century – Intifadas and organized resistance</div>
        <p>
          Popular uprisings, armed resistance, political organizing, and cultural struggle all developed as forms of Palestinian refusal. Despite Oslo and “peace process” language, the reality on the ground remained one of expanding settlements, walls, siege, and apartheid structures.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-time">Today – Ongoing occupation, apartheid, and resistance</div>
        <p>
          The occupation continues through military rule, siege, settler violence, imprisonment, and attempts to erase Palestinian existence — physically and narratively. At the same time, Palestinians in the homeland and the diaspora continue to resist, remember, document, and refuse to disappear.
