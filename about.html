      <strong>Returning to Haifa</strong> carries the name of the novel written by 
      <strong>Ghassan Kanafani</strong>, one of the most powerful Palestinian voices ever silenced
      by the occupation. This title is not literary decoration — it is inheritance, memory, and resistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <em>Returning to Haifa</em>, Kanafani confronts the brutal meaning of dispossession 
      and the impossible grief of a family returning to a home stolen through force.
      By the end of the novel, the truth stands naked: liberation cannot come from empty talks,
      negotiations, or illusions. It requires resistance — real resistance — against a settler
      project built on violence and erasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ghassan Kanafani knew this truth deeply, and he paid for it with his life.
      In 1972, the Zionist occupation assassinated him in Beirut through a car bomb.
      They murdered him alongside his 17-year-old niece <strong>Lamis</strong>,
      a young Palestinian girl he loved fiercely and protected with all the tenderness he had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their killing was not random. It was a targeted attempt to silence a revolutionary mind,
      a writer whose words sharpened the consciousness of an entire people,
      and a man who refused to normalize the violence of occupation.
      They murdered Lamis because they wanted to crush his heart — and through him,
      crush the spirit of Palestinian resistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page, and this website, exist to keep their memory alive.
      Ghassan's clarity, his refusal, his belief that literature and resistance walk side by side —
      and Lamis, whose life was stolen before it could fully bloom — are the heartbeat behind this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every word published here refuses erasure. Every page rejects colonial language.
      Every sentence honors the legacy of a man who taught us that truth without courage is worthless.
